<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The first step you will want to do when getting the app ready is clone the github repository.

### Prerequisites

  ```

We **strongly** advise using yarn as the default package manager when interacting with this project.

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to a `.env` and edit the values to match your environment.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

For development, you can use the OpenAPI Swagger documentation available at `localhost:port/docs/admin-service`.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage


The frontend currently has 3 urls.

* /join - join lobby url
* /game - game view for the players
* /admin/lobbies - Microsoft Active Directories protected url for admins for lobby management.
This should be moved to the admin view, but we did not have time!
